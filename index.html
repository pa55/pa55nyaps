<p>Not Yet Another Password Store</p>

<h2>
<a id="pa55-background" class="anchor" href="#pa55-background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PA55 background</h2>

<p>This is the Java reference implementation of the PA55 NYAPS. The <a href="http://pa55.github.io/pa55/">concept behind the original PA55</a> is that users do not need to remember complex passwords but should be able to deterministically generate complex passwords from rather simple information that the user can remember. Specifically, for every complex password, the user needed to remember a master secret (common for all passwords) and a hint (specific to each password).</p>

<p>For instance, with a master secret <em>This is a master secret</em> (really, it shouldn't be this simple!) and a hint <em>01011970@myservice</em> (emulating the fact that people use their birthdays to make their passwords) will generate a 12-character password <em>rEApgiO6YgN+</em> when the password iterations and hash functions are set to 250,000 and SHA-256 respectively. That is a nice password with a 72-bits entropy for <em>myservice</em>. Yet, while guessing <em>01011970@myservice</em> may be trivial for someone with background knowledge, guessing a truly unexpected master secret is not easy. Even a wrongly guessed master secret differing in just one character from the actual master secret will produce (with a very high probability) a very different password. Neither the master secret nor any hint is stored by the application. Thus, if either of these are lost, it is impossible to recover the corresponding complex passwords. That should not be a matter of concern because in the event of forgotten passwords, most services will allow resetting them albeit a minor inconvenience.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-limitations-of-pa55" class="anchor" href="#the-limitations-of-pa55" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The limitations of PA55</h3>

<p>There are two fundamental difficulties with PA55.</p>

<p>(1) Many services require users to change the passwords periodically. Thus, the user will have to remember the different hints used every time and this is not trivial. It is also not easy to remember multiple hints for multiple services. Since PA55 does not store any hint, it can become unmanageably hard to keep track of various hints.</p>

<p>(2) Many services require the users to specify passwords that draw characters from specific sets of characters, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, punctuation characters, and so on. The passwords generated by PA55 are Base64 encoded, which means they include characters from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and the set constituting the character + and /. However, the generated passwords may or may not include characters from all these sets. Thus, if the user wanted to generate passwords to contain only lowercase characters, digits and punctuation marks then PA55 cannot help.</p>

<h2>
<a id="whats-different-this-time" class="anchor" href="#whats-different-this-time" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's different this time?</h2>

<p>PA55 NYAPS has been developer to address the aforementioned shortcomings.</p>

<p>(1) NYAPS -- Not Yet Another Password Store -- actually stores (of course, encrypted) information, but not the complex passwords. Instead, PA55 NYAPS stores information on how to generate the passwords. One could see it as storing the <em>hint</em> in PA55. These are called <em>password generation settings</em> or <em>password settings</em> or simply <em>settings</em>. Each such encrypted file can contain multiple <em>settings</em> for multiple passwords. However, the master secret is still not stored and is used to generate the complex passwords.</p>

<p>(2) The <em>settings</em> stored include specifications of length, an issue number (which helps with generating new passwords when the services require them refreshed periodically), and the choice of character sets. The user can now choose to include characters from brackets, digits, lowercase letters, special characters and uppercase letters.</p>

<h2>
<a id="two-fundamental-questions" class="anchor" href="#two-fundamental-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Two fundamental questions</h2>

<p>(1) Why is it open-source?</p>

<p>We make PA55 open-source such that the users can see it for themselves that there is no funny business behind-the-scenes.</p>

<p>(2) There are plenty of password managers -- why PA55 NYAPS?</p>

<p>This is because these password managers store the passwords (even if encrypted). Thus, compromising those encrypted files leads to the disclosure of the passwords. PA55 NYAPS only stores encrypted settings. The master secret is never stored. Thus, the passwords cannot be generated even if the settings files are compromised (unless, of course, the user stores information about their master secret in that file!).</p>

<p>There are some password managers that had to ask their users to change their master passwords after their cloud servers got compromised. This is not the case with PA55 NYAPS. We do not store anything on our cloud servers. The user can store their settings files wherever they want, including on cloud storage services but the master secret is never stored.</p>

<h2>
<a id="some-technical-qa" class="anchor" href="#some-technical-qa" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Some technical Q&amp;A</h2>

<p>(Q1) What encryption is used for storing the files?</p>

<p>(A1) Industry-standard AES 128-bits in CTR mode with 256-bit HMAC on the ciphertext.</p>

<p>(Q2) What encryption is used for <em>optionally protecting</em> the QR code of the passwords?</p>

<p>(A2) Industry-standard AES 128-bits in CTR mode with 256-bit HMAC on the ciphertext.</p>

<p>(Q3) PA55 offered an option for specifying the hash function: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512. What happened to that?</p>

<p>(A3) PA55 NYAPS no longer offers that choice. The hash function used by the password based key derivation function (PBKDF2) is SHA-512.</p>

<p>(Q4) PA55 offered an option for specifying the iterations, e.g., 250K, 500K. Where is that now?</p>

<p>(A4) PA55 NYAPS no longer offers that choice. The rounds used by the password based key derivation function (PBKDF2) is fixed at 25,000 (25K).</p>

<p>(Q5) What random number generator is used in PA55 NYAPS in the password generation algorithm?</p>

<p>(A5) AES 128-bits in CTR mode is the basis of the deterministic random bits generator.</p>
